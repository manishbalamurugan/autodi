# AutoDI

An intelligent, agentic system designed to assist data scientists through natural language interaction. This tool combines large language models, function calling, and code generation to automate complex data processing workflows.

## Core Concepts

### Agentic Intelligence
The system operates as an autonomous agent that can:
- Understand complex natural language requests
- Break down tasks into logical steps
- Generate and execute code
- Handle errors and edge cases adaptively
- Provide explanations and reasoning
- Learn from user feedback

### Multi-Step Planning
The agent employs a sophisticated planning system:
1. **Task Analysis**: Breaks down complex requests into subtasks
2. **Tool Selection**: Identifies appropriate functions and methods
3. **Execution Planning**: Creates a sequence of operations
4. **Validation**: Checks for potential issues before execution
5. **Monitoring**: Tracks progress and handles failures

### Code Generation & Execution
- Dynamic Python code generation for custom operations
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Error handling and recovery
- Code optimization suggestions
- Integration with existing codebases
